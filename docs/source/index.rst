APEX (A PyTorch Extension)
===================================

This site contains the API documentation for AEPX (https://github.com/nvidia/apex),
a PyTorch extension with NVIDIA-maintained utilities.  Some of the code here will be included in upstream PyTorch eventually. The intention of APEX is to make up-to-date utilities available to users as quickly as possible.

Installation instructions can be found here:  https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex#quick-start.

Some other useful material, including GTC 2019 and Pytorch DevCon 2019 Slides, can be found here:  https://github.com/mcarilli/mixed_precision_references.
